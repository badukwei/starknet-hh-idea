# Project Proposal: Real-Name Verification Wallet on StarkNet

## Project Title

**Real-Name Verification Wallet on StarkNet**

## Problem Statement

In the blockchain space, many applications require users to undergo identity verification to meet compliance requirements such as **Know Your Customer (KYC)** and **Anti-Money Laundering (AML)** regulations. However, current identity verification processes are often complex, expensive, and user-unfriendly. Users are required to repeatedly submit their personal information across multiple platforms, leading to privacy and security risks.

## Solution

Develop a **Real-Name Verification Wallet** that integrates identity verification functionality using StarkNet's scalability and security features. This wallet allows users to complete real-name verification once and utilize it across all supporting decentralized applications (**dApps**) without the need to resubmit personal information. By leveraging **zero-knowledge proofs (zk-STARKs)**, the system can verify identity attributes without exposing sensitive data, thereby protecting user privacy.

## Key Features

1. **Integrated Real-Name Verification**: Users complete identity verification through a trusted third-party KYC provider.
2. **Zero-Knowledge Proofs**: Utilize zk-STARKs to verify identity information without revealing actual data.
3. **Unified Identity Authentication**: Verified identities can be used across all dApps that integrate this functionality.
4. **User-Friendly Interface**: An intuitive interface that makes it easy for users to complete verification and manage their wallet.

## Technology Stack

- **Blockchain Layer**: StarkNet (Ethereum Layer 2 scaling solution)
- **Smart Contracts**: Written in Cairo (StarkNet's native programming language)
- **Zero-Knowledge Proofs**: zk-STARKs
- **Frontend**: Next.js (React framework with server-side rendering)
- **Wallet Integration**: Support for StarkNet-compatible wallets like Argent X
- **Third-Party Services**: Integration with trusted KYC provider APIs

## Project Breakdown and Timeline

### Week 1

- **Project Planning and Design**
    - Define project scope and requirements.
    - Design system architecture and user flow.
- **Environment Setup**
    - Set up the development environment.
    - Familiarize the team with StarkNet and Cairo.

### Week 2

- **Smart Contract Development**
    - Write smart contracts for storing and verifying identity hashes.
    - Implement zero-knowledge proof logic for privacy protection.
- **Frontend Development**
    - Build the basic user interface using Next.js.
    - Include registration, login, and identity verification pages.

### Week 3

- **Integration with Third-Party KYC Services**
    - Connect with a trusted KYC provider's API to implement identity verification.
- **Testing and Optimization**
    - Conduct functional testing to ensure system stability.
    - Optimize user experience by simplifying operational processes.
- **Deployment and Presentation**
    - Deploy smart contracts to the StarkNet testnet.
    - Prepare demonstration materials to showcase project outcomes.

## Expected Outcomes

- **Functional Wallet Application**: Users can create a wallet and complete real-name verification.
- **Zero-Knowledge Identity Verification**: Successful implementation of zk-STARKs in the identity verification process.
- **Scalability**: Establishes a foundation for integrating more dApps and features in the future.

## Potential Impact

- **Improved User Experience**: Simplifies the identity verification process, reducing the need for repeated submissions.
- **Enhanced Privacy Protection**: Safeguards users' sensitive data through zero-knowledge proofs.
- **Compliance Facilitation**: Helps dApps meet KYC and AML requirements, promoting mainstream adoption of blockchain applications.

## Challenges and Mitigation Strategies

**Challenges**

- **Technical Complexity**: Steep learning curve for zero-knowledge proofs and the Cairo programming language.
- **Third-Party Service Integration**: Coordination required for API access from KYC providers.

**Mitigation Strategies**

- **Resource Utilization**: Leverage the StarkNet community and developer documentation to accelerate technical mastery.
- **Task Allocation**: Clearly divide responsibilities among team members to improve development efficiency.
- **Early Communication**: Reach out to KYC service providers early to obtain technical support.
