Project Proposal: Real-Name Verification Wallet on StarkNet
Project Title: Real-Name Verification Wallet on StarkNet
Problem Statement
In the blockchain space, many applications require users to undergo identity verification to meet compliance requirements such as KYC (Know Your Customer) and AML (Anti-Money Laundering) regulations. However, current identity verification processes are often complex, expensive, and user-unfriendly. Users are required to repeatedly submit their personal information across multiple platforms, leading to privacy and security risks.

Solution
Develop a Real-Name Verification Wallet that integrates identity verification functionality using StarkNet's scalability and security features. This wallet allows users to complete real-name verification once and utilize it across all supporting decentralized applications (dApps) without the need to resubmit personal information. By leveraging zero-knowledge proofs (zk-STARKs), the system can verify identity attributes without exposing sensitive data, thereby protecting user privacy.

Key Features
Integrated Real-Name Verification: Users complete identity verification through a trusted third-party KYC provider.
Zero-Knowledge Proofs: Utilize zk-STARKs to verify identity information without revealing actual data.
Unified Identity Authentication: Verified identities can be used across all dApps that integrate this functionality.
User-Friendly Interface: An intuitive interface that makes it easy for users to complete verification and manage their wallet.
Technology Stack
Blockchain Layer: StarkNet (Ethereum Layer 2 scaling solution)
Smart Contracts: Written in Cairo (StarkNet's native language)
Zero-Knowledge Proofs: zk-STARKs
Frontend: Next.js (React framework with server-side rendering)
Wallet Integration: Support for StarkNet-compatible wallets like Argent X
Third-Party Services: Integration with trusted KYC provider APIs
